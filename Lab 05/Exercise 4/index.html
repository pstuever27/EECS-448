        <p id="text">The rats were everywhere in New York City. As a child, I spent a good part of my days learning how to scam and avoid them. They lived on top of the garbage cans. They were also around the piles of unwashed laundry. They were another kind of creature, similar in purpose but dissimilar in appearance and mental capabilities. They weren’t timid. They didn’t care what you thought of them. They were all about their own survival.

            When I moved to Chicago, things had changed. The rats were a lot friendlier. Sure, they still lived on top of the garbage cans. But the young ones would come to my face and rub against my arms, begging for food and protection from the things larger than them. My boyfriend couldn’t handle it. He always told me I was crazy and that no animal could ever really have a “face,” but I convinced him. I convinced myself. It made me feel good to believe that I had found a friend in these smelly animals that I looked upon as pests.
            
            You see, they didn’t look like cute fuzzy bunnies. They didn’t have long, luscious tails. They didn’t snuggle up to you on your back porch. They were unsightly in their own unique ways. </p>
